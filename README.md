GEMINI News Search Agent

This project demonstrates how to create an internet search agent using Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash model, LangChain, and an Agent-based architecture. The agent can browse the web, find the latest news, and summarize it for the user. It's an excellent example of leveraging Generative AI and asynchronous Python for real-time web exploration and summarization.

Features

Generative AI Integration: Uses Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash model for intelligent responses.

LangChain Framework: Streamlines the workflow with LangChain’s modular AI tools.

Customizable Search: Allows flexible task definitions and search steps.

Asynchronous Execution: Optimized for non-blocking operations with Python's asyncio.

Prerequisites

Python: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed.

Environment Variables: A valid Google Gemini API key is required. Obtain it from the Google Cloud Console.
